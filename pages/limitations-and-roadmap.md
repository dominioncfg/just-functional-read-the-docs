# Limitations and Roadmap

## Current Limitations

| Limitation                              | Description                                   | Example         | Current Workaound  |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Variable/Opertator one Containing Other | One function containing to variables X and X1 | X+X1 Will break | X1+X2 Is Supported |

## Roadmap

### Native Function Support

Let's say you want to implement a function that takes 3 parameters and returns the max value something like this: "max(1,2,3)". Currently you cannot do this because you can only add Operators that are either binary or unary. So the idea is to implement something like that.

### Numeric Methods to solve Equations

The idea here is to add support for solving equations using well known algorithms.
