# The Big Picture

Just functional is a library....

## Design Principles

### Easy to use

Fluent...

### Immutability

You should know that the Function class and everything in it is immutable, that is, after the creation of the object is not posible to change anything (expression, evaluator, operators, constants etc), the reason for this is that immutable objects have several advangages, like there is no side-effects, improve performance, maintanibilty, and keep things simple. If you need to construct many function with the same configuration you should use the factory version.

## Use Cases

This section is all about exposing the use cases of the library.

[Evaluation](evaluation.html)

[Syntax Validation](syntax-validation.html)

## What's next

You can learn the more about the  [Functions](functions.html) or go to the [docs](../).
